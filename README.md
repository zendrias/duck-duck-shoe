# Duck Duck Shoe

## About The Site 
Duck Duck Shoe is a Ebay style website, where users can list items as well as view listings from others. Instead of purchasing items users can place reservations. I wanted also the users back-end to be similar to what is available in popular sites going into this.

I decided to go with this style of site because I have built ecom-stores in the past using website templates, and I figured it would be neat to build something similar from scratch.
